# NRIS_data
Analysis of Month-wise break-up of Non-Residential Indians (NRIs) Arrivals from 2015 to 2017 
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on NRIs data in India for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, with data collected for each month.
Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from the official Indian government data portal data.gov.in. You can download the dataset from this source.

Project Structure

    nris_India.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code and the step-by-step analysis of the NRIs data.
    
    nris_report: A brief report on the data analysis
    

#Requirements

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

    NumPy: A library for numerical computations.
    Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
    Matplotlib: A library for creating visualizations.
    Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

You can install these libraries using the following command:

pip install -r Requirements.txt

How to Use

    Download the dataset from data.gov.in.
    Open the nris_India.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
    Run the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook to perform the exploratory data analysis and generate insights on the NRIs data.

Project Goals
    Analyze the NRIs arrivals in India on a monthly basis for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017.
    Visualize trends and patterns in NRIs arrivals using charts and graphs.
    Provide insights into the data, such as seasonal variations and year-over-year comparisons.

    

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed to gain more insights from the data.

Happy analyzing!
